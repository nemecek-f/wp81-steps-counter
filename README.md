# wp81-steps-counter

Hello everyone,

I started this project a while ago, but did not find time (and maybe energy) to finish it. It is simple Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps that reads sensor data if the phone has one. 

In current state it displays number of steps taken in current day + active time and calculated distance travelled. Other features are work in progress. For example history, tracking feature (so you can measure the walk to your job for example) and even achievements. 

Should someone decide to finish this and release, I'll be more than happy. :)
